# knn-iris-classification
This project explores the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm using both simulated and real-world datasets. It visualizes how the choice of `k` influences decision boundaries, evaluates model performance using cross-validation, and applies dimensionality reduction with PCA for interpretable visual insights.
